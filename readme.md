Build this game with C, C#, C++ and SFML. This is a platform game, the player (“Red”) must race through the dangerous place and save Princess from Dark knight. Red can jump, runs, use sword skill, shoot arrows, and walk across each level. The worlds are full of enemies and platforms and open holes. If Red touches an enemy or falls down a hole or misses a jump, he will lose a life. If his life is out, the game is over.
